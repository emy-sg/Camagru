# Camagru
Camagru is the first web project outside of the common-core curriculum, that aims to create a simple image editing and sharing application that allows users to post or upload images with frames or stickers, which other user will like or comment.

The main purpose for this project was to teach the basic fundamentals of web development using CSS, HTML, JS with PHP acting as the backend / server side language.
